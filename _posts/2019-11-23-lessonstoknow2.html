<h1>3. If you lack charisma, work to gain it. If you don't have it, life will be much, much harder. </h1>
<p>It sucks, but it's true--those who have mastered charisma have mastered the key to surviving the confusing and complex game of life. Even if you're incompetent, if you're charismatic, people will put up with your faults for longer than if you are competent, yet wooden. Something that's always stuck me in my craw is the presumption that human beings are "rational" creatures, when in reality so much of what we do is irrational. Our world views and perspectives are inevitably marred by our biases and misconceptions and our own imperfect means of perception. Sometimes we just "know" when someone is good, even if they're not. Sometimes we feel someone has the look of a leader....then promptly find they cannot be put in charge of blowing their own nose without injury. Gut feelings can sometimes just be gas. Our instincts can be strong, but only as strong as the mind that processes them.</p>

<p>The point I'm getting at is, like the old saying goes, sometimes image is far more important than substance, at least in terms of making that essential first impression. Having a easy, cocksure demeanor and people skills is <i>essential</i> if you're looking to climb up the social ladder. Swagger, steeze[1], . There's been a million words for that one elusively difficult state of being: cool. It's such a hard concept to define, and in one simple four letter word. There's no magic formula for charisma, and I'm definitely no alchemist in that regard. But from what I can tell, here are some good starting points:</p>

<h2>3a. Be engaging...and not just with yourself</h2>
<p>Dale Carnegie's seminal work, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/B0006IU7JK/ref=sr_1_3?crid=31Q8E35W06DY0&keywords=dale+carnegie+how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&qid=1574810733&sprefix=dale+carn%2Caps%2C241&sr=8-3">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> is probably one of the best reads you can pick up. It's very much what the title states. One of the best ways to be engaging, Carnegie notes, is to focus less on yourself and more on what <i>other</i> people are interested in and talk about. Make them feel important, whether they're talking about how they learned to gut a fish at 5 and won the local contest in P'dunkville, or if they're working to create <a href="https://cen.acs.org/people/profiles/Podcast-97-lithium-ion-battery/97/i35">something utterly world-changing at 97 years-old.</a> Everyone wants to feel like the hero of their own story, and everyone's story is worth listening to. Follow my philosophy on these things: everyone is worthy of respect until they explicitly show otherwise.</p>

<p>Be a good listener. Ask lots of questions about people's motivations and interests. Allow them to clarify things even if you already perfectly understand them, but don't show puzzlement at what they've told you. Show curiosity. A person who feels listened to is a person who feels validated. And in turn, a person whose respect you have already won.</p>
<p>

<h2>3b. Be firm. Be calm. It's not the same thing as being a jerk.</h2>
<p>Don't always worry about being nice. If you're somebody to whom being nice comes naturally, great, you've already got a great skill in your toolkit. But at the same time, being invariably "nice" to the point of obsequiousness backfires. You come off as spineless. Slimy. ...Unctuous. We are socialized to see those who are overly nice as being exploiters in our midst; a form of inelegant costume just waiting to be ripped off to expose the ugly, garish pretender underneath. The sad thing is that, as someone who's been there, sometimes you're really just genuinely trying your hardest to be friendly in a world where people are disinclined to trust you for a variety of reasons, including race and socioeconomic factors. But I'm telling you now--if you don't develop a little backbone, you're going to get burned. <i>Hard.</i></p>

<p> In part one I explained how excessive apology can create uncertainty and doubt in your social interactions, and ultimately ruin your intentions. Being overly nice does the exact same thing. Very few people in this world are Fred Rogers, and unless you have his unique blend of earnest warmth and stylish sweater jackets, don't try to be. It won't suit you and most people will consider it weird. Don't be afraid to push back when people push you--they'll very quickly figure out what they can get away with, and it will be much harder to get them to stop trying to exploit or disrespect you at every opportunity. If people push you....<b>push back.</b> You don't have to be aggressive, but it's true that if you don't stand up for yourself, there's a 99% chance no one will.</p>

<p>Instead of being nice, focus on being comfortable--and that includes in moments of disagreement. Another Carnegie lesson states that, in essence, there's no way to win an argument by telling someone that they're wrong. They double down and despise you. When it comes to disagreements, express your disagreements while also avoiding delegitimizing the opposite side. You'll gain respect from both the person you disagree with, as well as any audience, by being able to confidently express yourself, even in an uncomfortable situation, without putting anyone down. That just screams "cool" and shows you can separate your emotions from your responses on some level. It's just jarringly different enough to work.

<h2>Not everyone can be charismatic. That's okay. Be you and be happy in that<h2>

 <p><b>Takeaway</b>:Develop some level of charisma. You don't have to be a deific manifestation of human potential, but find the balance between what people like and what you're actually like. If you just can't be charismatic, at least be genuine. Nobody can fault you too much for that in the end.</p>

<h1>4. Do whatever it takes to become proficient in something deemed valuable by others. </h1>

<h1>5. If people don't like or respect you, don't push it. Find new people.</h1>
