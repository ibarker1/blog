<h1>3. If you lack charisma, work to gain it. If you don't have it, life will be much, much harder. </h1>
<p>It sucks, but it's true--those who have mastered charisma have mastered the key to surviving the confusing and complex game of life. Even if you're incompetent, if you're charismatic, people will put up with your faults for longer than if you are competent, yet wooden. Something that's always stuck me in my craw is the presumption that human beings are "rational" creatures, when in reality so much of what we do is irrational. Our world views and perspectives are inevitably marred by our biases and misconceptions and our own imperfect means of perception. Sometimes we just "know" when someone is good, even if they're not. Sometimes we feel someone has the look of a leader....then promptly find they cannot be put in charge of blowing their own nose without injury. Gut feelings can sometimes just be gas. Our instincts can be strong, but only as strong as the mind that processes them.</p>

<p>The point I'm getting at is, like the old saying goes, sometimes image is far more important than substance, at least in terms of making that essential first impression. Having a easy, cocksure demeanor and people skills is <i>essential</i> if you're looking to climb up the social ladder. Some know it as swagger, others call it steeze[1]. There's been a million words for that one elusively difficult state of being: cool. It's such a hard concept to define, and in one simple four letter word. There's no magic formula for charisma, and I'm definitely no alchemist in that regard. But from what I can tell, here are some good starting points:</p>

<h2>1. Be engaging...and not just with yourself</h2>
  <p>Dale Carnegie's seminal work, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/B0006IU7JK/ref=sr_1_3?crid=31Q8E35W06DY0&keywords=dale+carnegie+how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&qid=1574810733&sprefix=dale+carn%2Caps%2C241&sr=8-3">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> is probably one of the best reads you can pick up. It's very much what the title states. One of the best ways to be engaging, Carnegie notes, is to focus less on yourself and more on what <i>other</i> people are interested in and talk about. Make them feel important, whether they're talking about how they learned to gut a fish at 5 and won the local contest in Podunkville, or if they're working to create <a href="https://cen.acs.org/people/profiles/Podcast-97-lithium-ion-battery/97/i35">something utterly world-changing at 97 years-old.</a> Everyone wants to feel like a hero of their own story, and everyone's story is worth listening to. Follow my philosophy on these things: everyone is worthy of respect until they explicitly show otherwise.</p>

  Be a good listener. Ask lots of questions about their motivations. Allow them to clarify things even if you already perfectly understand them. A person who feels listened to is a person who feels validated. And in turn, a person whose respect you have already won.

<h2>2. Be firm. It's not the same thing as being a jerk.</h2>

 <p><b>Takeaway</b>:Develop some level of charisma. You don't have to be a deific manifestation of human potential, but find the balance between what people like and what you're actually like. If you just can't be charismatic, at least be genuine. Nobody can fault you too much for that in the end.</p>

<h1>4. Do whatever it takes to become proficient in something deemed valuable by others. </h1>

<h1>5. If people don't like or respect you, don't push it. Find new people.</h1>
