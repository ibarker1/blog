<h1>1. Nobody cares that much about you, one way or another.</h1>
<p> It sucks, I know. We're raised to believe that people out in the world care about us and will look out for us when we need them most. Get this into your head as soon as possible, and make sure it lodges in <i>deep</i>:
<p><b>That.
Is.
Not.
True.
At.
All.</b><p>

<p>Most people around you are concerned with one thing, and one thing only: themselves. Almost everyone is the star of their own universe, and their immediate family and friends form the closest celestial bodies that surround them. The rest of us are just chunks of space dust destined to burn up in their radiance. This isn't always true, though. As many can attest, even close family can sometimes deem you disposable if you stand between them and their own self-interest, short-sighted or not.</p>

It's important to understand, however, that this does not mean that they actively <i>hate</i> you. Rather, they just don't care about you one way or another. Most people are concerned with putting bread on the table, seeking out happiness, and the means and methods to secure comfort and security. They literally do not think much of you one way or another unless you fulfill one of these basic requirements (more on this later).

One of the most liberating aspects of growing up is realizing that most people don't really care about you. It's also one of the most alienating and scary. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre

<h1>2. Apologize tactically, not profusely. </h1>
<p>I am someone guilty of the act of chronic apology. We are (if we're lucky) taught to be humble, self-effacing, and willing to admit guilt and wrongdoing. For every one person like that, however, there's another who was taught that apology is a sign of retreat, and to retreat is to admit defeat.

  We live in a world of subtle power plays and psychological trickery; most of this game is played subconsciously

<h1>4. Do whatever it takes to become proficient in something deemed valuable by others. </h1>
