<h1>1. Nobody cares that much about you, one way or another.</h1>
<p> It sucks, I know. We're raised to believe that people out in the world care about us and will look out for us when we need them most. I have to break it to you:
<p><b>That.
Is.
Not.
True.
At.
All.</b><p>

<p>Most people around you are concerned with one thing, and one thing only: themselves. Mind you, this notion of themselves extends to their immediate family and friends....sometimes. As many can attest, even close family can sometimes deem you disposable if you stand between them and their own self-interest, short-sighted or not.</p>

It's important to understand, though, that this does not mean that they actively <i>hate</> you. Rather, they literally just don't care about you one way or another. Most people are concerned with putting bread on the table, seeking out happiness, and the means and methods to secure comfort and security. They literally do not think much of you one way or another.

<h1>2. Apologize tactically, not profusely. </h1>
<p>
<h1>3. If you lack charisma, work to gain it. If you don't have it, life will be much, much harder. </h1>

<h1>4. Do whatever it takes to become proficient in something deemed valuable by others. </h1>
