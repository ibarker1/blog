<h1>1. Nobody cares that much about you, one way or another.</h1>
<p> It sucks, I know. We're raised to believe that people out in the world care about us and will look out for us when we need them most. Get this into your head as soon as possible, and make sure it lodges in <i>deep</i>:
<p><b>That.
Is.
Not.
True.
At.
All.</b><p>

<p>Most people around you are concerned with one thing, and one thing only: themselves. Almost everyone is the star of their own universe, and their immediate family and friends form the closest celestial bodies that surround them. The rest of us are just chunks of space dust destined to burn up in their radiance. If your chunk of dust can aggregate enough mass (that is, <i>value</i>, you may well become the next body of interest in their microcosm. (This isn't always true, though. As many can attest, even close family can sometimes deem you disposable if you stand between them and their own self-interest, short-sighted or not.)</p>

It's important to understand, however, that this does not mean that they actively <i>hate</i> you. Rather, they just don't care about you one way or another. Most people are concerned with putting bread on the table, seeking out happiness, and the means and methods to secure comfort and security. They literally do not think much of you one way or another unless you fulfill one of these basic requirements (more on this later).

One of the most liberating aspects of growing up is realizing that most people don't really care about you. It's also one of the most alienating and scary. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre

<h1>2. Apologize tactically, not profusely. </h1>
<p>I am someone guilty of the act of chronic apology. It has hurt me immensely. We are (if we're lucky) taught to be humble, self-effacing, and willing to admit guilt and wrongdoing. For every one person like that, however, there's another who was taught that apology is a sign of retreat, and to retreat is to admit defeat. To some, budging even an inch is losing the fight before you've even put up your fists. Those people are ridiculous, but they exist.

We live in a world of subtle power plays and psychological trickery; most of this game is played subconsciously. Too much apology equates to being unsure of what you say, and ultimately being unwilling or unable to stand by your actions where it matters most. Mind you, this isn't some whiny cliche like "nice guys finish last." Rather, it's an appeal to our nature as social animals. Although I would not say humans necessarily crave hierarchy, <i> a la Peterson</i>, they do tend to establish a mental pecking order. Those who exhibit confidence and a surefire nature get ahead, while those constantly apologizing for slights both perceived and real are left behind and not taken seriously.

<p>Part of that is from the rationale explained above; another serious part of it is just that being around constant apologizers is <i>exhausting</i>. A lack of confidence is infectious; similiar to group paranoia, someone who constantly apologizes spreads self-doubt, both between individuals and within groups. It's also mentally taxing to have to figure out, "should I mollify this person? Do they want me to make them feel better?" And the big question, relating back to point #1: "Why should I care?" Eventually people will tune you out because it's simply easier psychologically to <i>not</i> figure out what your case is. 
<h1>3. If you lack charisma, work to gain it. If you don't have it, life will be much, much harder. </h1>

<h1>4. Do whatever it takes to become proficient in something deemed valuable by others. </h1>
