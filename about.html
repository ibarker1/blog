<p> <b>About the Author</b>
  <p> Who is I.J. Barker? He's an entomology enthusiast, a bicycling advocate, and a guy who's gone through more job applications (and rejections) than he cares to admit. He's an admittedly weird guy who finds his zen in the little things, like bike maintenance and tending to aquariums.</p>
  <p> He's also a person who has learned a lot, and wants to share a lot with you for the sake of your own success. Even at the risk of oversharing. Why?</p>
  <p> <i>Well, let's drop the stuffy third person reference for a bit first...</i>
    <p>Because I think you're worth it, friend. Let's face it: life is hard, and making the cut is harder. Many people out there are suffering in silence, putting on a brave face and acting as if their lives are amazing when they're still struggling behind the scenes emotionally, physically and financially. I'm out there struggling, too. I hear you, and I intend to uplift you.</p>

<b>About the Blog</b>
<p>I started this blog as a way of being able to speak in a slightly more free, open format than professional platforms like LinkedIn. I don't trust most other social media platforms (looking at you, <i>Facebook...</i>) but believe I have important insights to share with other young (okay, not that young) professionals out there who still have yet to get their due.</p>
<p>This blog will focus on life improvement, both in terms of improving your perspective on life as well as through practicable skills you can develop and build off of. You'll also get a dose of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archilochus" target="_blank">obscure Greek poets</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam" target ="_blank"> philosophical Persian polymaths.</a>
You'll likely also see some samples of my VO work as I focus on improvement of my own skills and sharing written pieces that I think you should hear. All of this is of course subject to change, so hang tight! </p>
